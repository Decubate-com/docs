Additionally, by allocating a portion of tokens to the treasury, Decubate is ensuring that the project has the resources it needs to fund ongoing development and expansion, while still maintaining a significant portion of tokens for the community.","Furthermore, Decubate's token distribution is designed to incentivize long-term commitment and investment, with gradual vesting of tokens over time for key stakeholders such as the team and advisors.

This can help to create a more stable and committed community of token holders, who are aligned with the long-term success of the project.

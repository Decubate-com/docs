Liquidity pool tokens are utilized within decentralized exchanges as liquidity, which makes trading tokens possible. Anyone can provide the two trading pair tokens to any liquidity pool in exchange for LP tokens holding a percentage of that specific pool."]},{"i":"how-does-liquidity-staking-work-and-what-can-you-gain","l":"How does liquidity staking work, and what can you gain?","p":["LP tokens earn holders a percentage of the trading fees within that specific pool.

When the ratio of the two assets held is unequal, likely due to a dramatic increase in the price of one of the tokens, it can lead to an impermanent loss of value, and the liquidity provider ultimately losses out on one of their asset’s profits. A loss can become permanent if the liquidity provider prematurely removes its funds from the pool before the price has the opportunity to recover."]}],[{"l":"Club Overview","p":["They say it’s hard to master two things at once.

## Prerequisites

Retype is installed using either [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/), or the [`dotnet`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) CLI.

You only need one of those three package managers as a prerequisite, although all three could be installed on your computer too. It's up to you. :raised_hands:

## Install

It takes just a few seconds to install Retype using any of the following commands. Choose the command based on a package manager you have installed on your computer.

+++ yarn
```
yarn global add retypeapp
retype watch
```

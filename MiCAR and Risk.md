# Decubate & MiCAR: Ensuring Compliance and Security for Our Clients and Users

The crypto industry is evolving, and so are the regulations that shape it. With the introduction of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR), all platforms offering crypto-asset services to EU users must secure a license to continue operating in the European market. At Decubate, we welcome this regulatory clarity and remain committed to full compliance while ensuring a seamless experience for our users. As of 31 July 2025, Decubate is authorised by the Autoriteit FinanciÃ«le Markten (AFM) as a cryptoâ€‘asset service provider under Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 (MiCAR), with licence no. 41000018, and is listed in the ESMA public register of CASPs.

Decubate is licensed to provide the following services:

1. Custody and administration of crypto-assets;
2. Execution of orders on behalf of clients;
3. Placing of crypto-assets

## What Is MiCAR and Why Does It Matter?

MiCAR is the European Unionâ€™s comprehensive framework for regulating crypto-asset service providers (CASPs). It aims to create a unified and secure market, protecting investors while fostering innovation. One key requirement is that all launchpads serving EU users must obtain a license to continue offering services like token sales and placements.

## Why MiCAR Compliance Matters

MiCAR represents a significant step forward for the crypto industry, offering greater security, transparency, and investor protection. Many platforms may struggle to meet these requirements, but Decubate is ahead of the curve, ensuring compliance while maintaining the same trusted experience for our users.

By aligning with MiCAR, Decubate reinforces its position as a safe, compliant, and forward-thinking launchpad that prioritizes long-term security for entrepreneurs and investors.

# **Risk Statement**

The information contained in this whitepaper is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice, financial advice, or any other form of recommendation.

Cryptocurrency investments and related activities involve significant risks, including market volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and potential loss of capital.

We strongly encourage you to do your own research and carefully evaluate the risks, benefits, and objectives of any cryptocurrency-related activities before participating.

Transactions in crypto-assets involve significant risk and may not be suitable for all investors. Before trading, please consider the following risks:

1. **Market risks**: the volatility of crypto-assets can result in substantial gains but also in significant losses, even in the loss of your entire investment. In addition, large trades may face challenges in execution due to limited market liquidity, resulting in unfavorable pricing or delays.

2. **Operational risks:** the infrastructure underlying our Launch Pad and the blockchain technology itself may be subject to technical failures or glitches. These issues can disrupt the crypto-asset sale process, lead to transaction delays, or even to the loss of your entire investment.

3. **Regulatory and compliance risks**: regulatory changes in your jurisdiction may impact your ability to trade or hold certain crypto-assets.

4. **Financial risks**: although Decubate conducts a thorough due diligence on the projects, not all projects listed on the Launch Pad will succeed. Some may fail to meet their goals or run out of funding, leading to the loss of your investment, even to the loss of your entire investment.

5. **Market practices**: market manipulation can influence the price or demand for a crypto-asset. Such manipulation can result in significant losses, even in the loss of your entire investment.

6. **Legal risks**: before using the Launch Pad, Decubateâ€™s General Terms and Conditions and the specific White Paper should be read carefully. Legal ownership and control over crypto-assets can be complex and is often subject to the specific terms of the smart contract.

7. **Price risk**: crypto-asset prices are highly volatile and can experience sudden and significant fluctuations. You may lose part or all of your investment.

8. **Counterparty risk**: there is a possibility that exchanges, brokers, or trading entities may default on their obligations, leading to potential loss of assets or disrupted trading.

Ensure you fully understand these risks and seek professional advice if needed before engaging in crypto-asset transactions.

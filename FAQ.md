-   **Q**: I've staked my DCB tokens but my tier isn’t showing up, what should I do?
-   **A**: If you hold enough DCB to reach a tier but it's not reflected on your profile, consider the following:

Ensure you have passed KYC.

-   Verify that you have connected the correct wallet—the one holding your DCB and ensure it is your verified wallet.
-   Confirm you are logged in with the correct email.
-   Check your RPC endpoints; slow endpoints might cause UI latency with the blockchain. The best BNB RPC can be found at Chainlist.

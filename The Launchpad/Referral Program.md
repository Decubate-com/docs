# Decubate Referral Program
--![](../static\Referral-system.png)
At the core of Decubate's mission is the commitment to community growth and engagement. We have our Referral Program to empower our community further. Regardless of your tier level, every successful referral rewards both the referrer and the referee with 50 $DCB each.

However, to participate in the program, referrers are required to have at least GOLD tier status on our platform, and the referee must become at least Bronze Tier, ensuring the dedication of our community's supporters. Additionally, all participants must undergo identity verification (KYC) to maintain a secure, trustworthy environment and have a verified wallet to collect and safeguard their referral rewards.

This program update reflects our commitment to collective progress and underscores the importance of fostering a thriving community where every member is rewarded for their contributions.

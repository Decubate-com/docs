# Decubate Decentralized Refund Policy
At Decubate, we believe in protecting our users' investments and ensuring the transparency of token sales on our platform. That's why we've created a refund policy that provides the security and legality of every crowdfunding event. Our approach protects against continuous TGE delays, project rug pulls, malicious third-party refund practices, and team mismanagement while remaining compliant with Dutch regulations. Our revolutionary smart contract-based policy provides project teams and investors with a seamless and secure experience.

Decubate is excited to announce the launch of our latest feature, a decentralized refund policy that empowers investors to manage their investments effectively. We believe in offering innovative solutions to protect our users and bring transparency to the token sales on our platform. Our new refund policy is designed to help mitigate risks for investors while ensuring the success of projects fundraising on the Decubate platform.

## How Decubate's Decentralized Refund Policy Works:
Decubate's decentralized refund policy results from careful consideration and collaboration within our community. The policy was voted on by the Decubate DAO, with an overwhelming 92% majority from Decubate investors, highlighting the strong support for this innovative feature.

## Refund eligibility: 
All users, regardless of their tier (from Base to Diamond), are eligible to receive up to **100% refunds** during the Grace Period (5 to 7 days). The policy introduces a predetermined Grace Period that starts at the token listing and continues until the end of the grace period. During this time, users can either claim tokens or request a refund. If tokens are claimed, they lose refund eligibility.

## Protection fee: 
After the third Decubate DAO vote, we introduced a protection fee, requiring investors to stake DCB tokens to access tier benefits. This encourages tier upgrades and attracts notable investors, with all protection fees funding DCB buybacks, burns, or liquidity pools, in order to make better investment decisions, and attract more prominent investors to our platform. 100% of all protection fees go to DCB buybacks & burns or DCB liquidity pools.

Decubate's refund policy reflects our commitment to transparency and investor empowerment in the web3 space. By offering security and protection, we aim to build trust and ensure the longevity of investments and projects on our platform.

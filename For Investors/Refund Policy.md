# Decubate Decentralized Refund Policy
At Decubate, we believe in protecting our users' investments and ensuring the transparency of token sales on our platform. That's why we've created a comprehensive refund policy that provides the security and legality of every crowdfunding event. Our approach protects against continuous TGE delays, project rug pulls, malicious third-party refund practices, and team mismanagement while remaining compliant with Dutch regulations. Our revolutionary smart contract-based policy provides project teams and investors with a seamless and secure experience.

Decubate is excited to announce the launch of our latest feature, a decentralized refund policy that empowers investors to manage their investments effectively. We believe in offering innovative solutions to protect our users and bring transparency to the token sales on our platform. Our new refund policy is designed to help mitigate risks for investors while ensuring the success of projects fundraising on the Decubate platform.

## How Decubate's Decentralized Refund Policy Works:
Decubate's decentralized refund policy results from careful consideration and collaboration within our community. The policy was voted on by the Decubate DAO, with an overwhelming 92% majority from Decubate investors, highlighting the strong support for this innovative feature.

## Refund eligibility: 
Users eligible for a refund can receive up to 100% of their funds if they choose to refund, depending on their Decubate tier. The policy introduces a predetermined Grace Period that starts at the token listing and continues until the end of the grace period. During this time, users can either claim tokens or request a refund. If tokens are claimed, they lose refund eligibility.

## Protection fee: 
We introduced the protection fee after the third Decubate DAO vote. Investors who use the Decubate platform must stake DCB tokens to receive a tier. The higher the tier, the higher the protection level. This system encourages users to upgrade tiers, make better investment decisions, and attract more prominent investors to our platform. 100% of all protection fees go to DCB buybacks & burns or DCB liquidity pools.

Investors can increase the investment protection percentage during the grace period based on their tier. The base tier has no protection, while higher tiers offer increasing protection levels: Bronze 50%, Silver 75%, Gold 80%, Platinum 90%, Diamond 95%, and each additional Diamond stacked increases protection by 0.5%.

In conclusion, Decubate's decentralized refund policy demonstrates our commitment to empowering investors and ensuring transparency in the web3 space. We are confident that this feature will provide additional security and protection for our users, fostering trust and long-term success for investors and projects on our platform.

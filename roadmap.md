# Roadmap
At the beginning of 2022, we set an aggressive roadmap to position Decubate for long-term success. While market conditions have cooled from the highs of the DeFi / NFT / DAO / GameFi summer, weâ€™re staying the course and are building through the bear market.

The two main aspects of our roadmap consist out of our software solutions and bringing value to DCB and our community.

**The vision of our software solutions:** Decubate Token Management System (TMS) exists out of a suite of connected white-labeled management tools for minting, vesting, token/nft staking, governance, tiers system, liquidity farming, on-chain statistics, and much more. TMS enables innovators to interact with any EVM-compatible blockchain through our highly intuitive, customizable, and incredibly easy to deploy solutions.

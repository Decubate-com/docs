# About us
Decubate is a web3 software company that makes token management easy. We empower crypto projects to launch a token without any technical know-how. We do this through a suite of no-code token management products.

Our mission is to accelerate the mass adoption of digital assets by arming crypto projects with the resources they need to launch and manage their token.

## Our Values

### Integrity
We are honest and have strong moral principles. We are not financially motivated; we are motivated by doing the right thing and work only with people who share this view.
						
### Collaboration
We believe in sharing value for common use. This spirit drives our internal processes like sharing work for feedback peer review; and externally for more fair value creation & capture.

### Equality
Our ultimate aim is to democratize finance for a more fair and equal playing field in business and society. Our business model of software tools & crowdfunding is rooted in this aim.
						
### Iteration
We are process-oriented, repeating and wind tunneling our steps to reach the best version of a product or the best solution for a business.
											
### Transparency
In the spirit of the blockchain, we believe openness is the way to a more just future. We do not fear copycats or competition because we’re focused on the end goal in a “rising tide lifts all boats” mentality.
						
### Cultivation
We are not middlemen that hoard knowledge for our own power. We believe in sharing knowledge & wisdom to help people to develop themselves and the next generation.

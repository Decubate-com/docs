# About us
As the go-to platform for web3 businesses, Decubate empowers entrepreneurs to launch, manage, and grow with ease. We're proud to partner with them and drive growth together.

We aim to be the leading platform for accessible, innovative, and credible solutions that empower businesses and investors to seamlessly participate in the decentralized economy and unlock its full potential.

## Our Values

### Integrity
We are honest and have strong moral principles. We are not financially motivated; we are motivated by doing the right thing and work only with people who share this view.
						
### Collaboration
We believe in sharing value for common use. This spirit drives our internal processes like sharing work for feedback peer review; and externally for more fair value creation & capture.

### Equality
Our ultimate aim is to democratize finance for a more fair and equal playing field in business and society. Our business model of software tools & crowdfunding is rooted in this aim.
						
### Iteration
We are process-oriented, repeating and wind tunneling our steps to reach the best version of a product or the best solution for a business.
											
### Transparency
In the spirit of the blockchain, we believe openness is the way to a more just future. We do not fear copycats or competition because we’re focused on the end goal in a “rising tide lifts all boats” mentality.
						
### Cultivation
We are not middlemen that hoard knowledge for our own power. We believe in sharing knowledge & wisdom to help people to develop themselves and the next generation.
